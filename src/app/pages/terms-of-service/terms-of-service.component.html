          <b> InStockRx Services.</b> The Website is an Internet-based
          electronic marketplace connecting buyers and sellers ("Participants")
          of a variety of pharmaceutical related products (and services) made
          available for use and purchase by the Participants (collectively,
          "Participant Services"). As owner of the Website, InStockRx manages
          the functional and technical operations required to maintain and
          support the Website (the "InStockRx Services"). Although the Website
          may be referred to as an online pharmaceutical auction site, InStockRx
          is not an auctioneer or a clearinghouse and does not sell Participant
          Services. Because it does not sell Participant Services, InStockRx
          explicitly and specifically disclaims any responsibility for the
          quality, safety, or legality of the products advertised, the truth or
          accuracy of the listings, the ability of the Participants to sell or
          deliver the Participant Services, or the ability of Participants to
          pay for them. InStockRx cannot ensure that a Participant will actually
          complete a transaction. You are responsible for accurately entering
          your information into InStockRx.com. InStockRx will not review such
          information as a part of the InStockRx Services. Information submitted
          by you or generated from transactions through the Website (absent any
          personably identifiable information) will be available on the
          InStockRx system to all pharmacies within the service area and others
          per this Agreement for development of statistical data to facilitate
          efficiency and competition in the field of pharmacy services.
          InStockRx may provide additional InStockRx Services services. Any
          InStockRx Services that you order from InStockRx.com for which
          InStockRx charges fees shall be paid for by you with valid funds at
          the time you place your order. InStockRx may, at its sole discretion,
          delete or change some or all of the InStockRx Services or Participant
          Services now or offered in the future at any time, free and clear of
          any claim of vested rights or other entitlement as a Participant of
          InStockRx.com or otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> Participant Services.</b> Participant Services are offered and
          sold by the Participants. If you have a claim or dispute regarding any
          Participant Services, you must deal directly with the affected
          Participants, not InStockRx. Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable
          law, you release InStockRx from and waive any and all claims, demands,
          and causes of action of every kind and nature, known and unknown,
          which exist or hereafter arise against InStockRx related in any way to
          such claim or dispute over Participant Services. Although Participants
          are expected to input accurate information on the Website, on occasion
          pricing, typographical, or other mistakes may occur. InStockRx
          reserves and shall have the right to cancel any transactions processed
          with inaccurate information submitted by any Participants, and the
          return of any amounts paid by you to InStockRx in the cancelled
          transaction shall be your sole remedy.

              the amount of time required by applicable state or federal law or
              48 hours, whichever is less, the pedigree of each item posted and
              sold on the site including but not limited to the Transaction
              History (Statement of Origin) which traces the drug from the point
              of manufacture and contains information about all transactions
              that the item undergoes until it reaches the Buyer. You agree that
              each item posted for sale in the marketplace meets the compliance
              and reporting criteria of the DSCSA and any promulgated
              regulations then in force.

              expressly warrants that the item was purchased for a specific
              patient need or declared public health emergency, and will be
              tracked in accordance with the DSCSA. InStockRx will debit the
              Buyer’s account at the time the Seller confirms the availability
              of the Prescription Drug(s) and produces the packing slip and
              shipping label. All orders are final, and once placed, cannot be
              cancelled or retracted by the Buyer. Placing an order does not
              complete the sale. Sellers have two (2) business days from the
              date the order is placed to confirm the item is available and
              shipped. The sale is complete when the Buyer confirms delivery
              within InStockRx or does not dispute the delivery within two (2)
              business days of receipt, whichever is sooner.

          InStockRx.com account has been terminated or you update your payment
          preferences or we are notified by you in writing to cancel it in such
          time as to afford InView Analytics, Inc commercially reasonable
          opportunity to act on it. You represent and warrant that any bank

          If the above noted payment dates fall on a weekend or holiday, you
          understand that the payments may be executed on the following business
          day. For ACH debits to my checking account, you understand that
          because these are electronic transactions, these funds may be
          withdrawn from my account as soon as each order is placed. In the case
          of an ACH Transaction being rejected for Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) I
          understand that InStockRx Inc. may at its discretion attempt to
          process the charge again within 30 days, and agree to an additional
          $39.99 charge for each attempt returned NSF which will be initiated as
          a separate transaction from the authorized recurring payment. I
          acknowledge that the origination of ACH transactions to my account
          must comply with the provisions of U.S. law.
